            <failure type="description">The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming&#xA;ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the&#xA;SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by&#xA;end user applications.&#xA;&#xA;The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter&#xA;BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of&#xA;the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS&#xA;recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function&#xA;returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain&#xA;is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains&#xA;internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on&#xA;to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur.

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate&#xA;an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL&#xA;type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the&#xA;sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by&#xA;periods.&#xA;&#xA;When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large&#xA;(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds&#xA;of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long&#xA;time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the&#xA;sub-identifiers in bytes (*).&#xA;&#xA;With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /&#xA;identifiers in string form was introduced.

If the use is for the mere purpose&#xA;of display, the severity is considered low.&#xA;&#xA;In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,&#xA;CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509&#xA;certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.&#xA;&#xA;The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a&#xA;100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only&#xA;impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client&#xA;authentication.&#xA;&#xA;In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,&#xA;such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way&#xA;that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered&#xA;not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,&#xA;and the severity is therefore considered low.</failure>

            <failure type="description">The UNIX editor Vim prior to version 9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error in argument list handling. When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was just opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes the window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument list that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it will crash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.</failure>

            <failure type="description">Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), the search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.</failure>

            <failure type="description">Vim is an improved version of the unix vi text editor. When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It&#39;s not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</failure>

            <failure type="description">Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an&#xA;empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to&#xA;be sent to the peer.&#xA;&#xA;Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences&#xA;such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue&#xA;could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent&#xA;to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications&#xA;that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of&#xA;supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never&#xA;be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by&#xA;accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling&#xA;application.&#xA;&#xA;The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS&#xA;applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN&#xA;(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and&#xA;is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more&#xA;widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of&#xA;protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns&#xA;the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the&#xA;client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the&#xA;first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap&#xA;between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is&#xA;called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and&#xA;returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports&#xA;that there was no overlap in the lists).&#xA;&#xA;This function is typically called from a server side application callback for&#xA;ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list&#xA;of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in&#xA;length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never&#xA;normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the&#xA;SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list&#xA;supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the&#xA;application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has&#xA;accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has&#xA;accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len&#xA;parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a &#34;no overlap&#34;&#xA;response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it&#xA;will be vulnerable to this problem.&#xA;&#xA;In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select&#xA;a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol&#xA;in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes&#xA;from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.&#xA;However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a&#xA;client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the&#xA;application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of&#xA;confidentiality will occur.&#xA;&#xA;This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most&#xA;likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not&#xA;widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.&#xA;Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active&#xA;exploitation unlikely.&#xA;&#xA;The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.&#xA;&#xA;Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of&#xA;OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they&#xA;become available.</failure>
